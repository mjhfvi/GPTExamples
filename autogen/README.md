config_list Examples:
"temperature": 0.9,
# value between 0 and 1 that controls the randomness of the generated text.
# A higher temperature will result in more random and diverse text,
# while a lower temperature will result in more

"cache_seed": None,
# To disable caching completely, set cache_seed to "None"
# This is a random seed value. A seed is used in random number generation to ensure reproducibility.
# By setting a seed, you can ensure that the random processes in the model produce the same results
# every time itâ€™s run with that seed. The value '42' is just an example;
# you can change this seed value for different trials to get varied results.
